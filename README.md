# Chucklulator - The Hilarious Calculator

Welcome to Chucklulator - The Hilarious Calculator! This project is a simple calculator that not only provides you with mathematical answers but also adds a touch of humor to your day by fetching a random joke through the [JokeAPI](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/). This project was created as a part of my journey to learn JSP & Servlets and to explore the process of fetching data from an API.

## Features

- Basic calculator functionality.
- Integration with the JokeAPI to display a random joke.
- Designed to facilitate learning of JSP & Servlet concepts.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- JSP (JavaServer Pages)
- Servlets
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [JokeAPI](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/) - API for fetching random jokes.

## How to Use

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Deploy the project on a servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat).
4. Access the application through your browser (e.g., http://localhost:8080/Chucklulator).

## Learning Objectives

This project was created as part of my learning journey to:
- Understand and implement JSP & Servlet concepts.
- Gain hands-on experience in fetching data from the [JokeAPI](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/).
- Enhance my skills in Java web development.

## Acknowledgments
